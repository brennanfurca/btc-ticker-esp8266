# Bitcoin price ticker with ESP8266 (realtime websockets)

* 7-segment 8-bit - or - Dot Matrix LED Display support with 32x8px
* ~~bitstamp &~~ bitfinex websocket interfacing for lightning fast, real time updates!
* solderless build possible (if you order the display with pre-soldered pin headers)
* low power (<0.5W), cheap to build (around 5 EUR)

## components
* ESP8266 Wemos D1 R2 Uno ([link](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/cN7TWnfi)) or ESP8266s/NodeMCUs ([link](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/bqhV6bqg)) or Wemos D1 Mini
* 7 segment display with MAX7219 ([link](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/7uottDW)) or Dot Matrix display ([link](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/Jckdk7Q))
* dupont cables (female-to-male) and maybe a cheap antenna ;)

## how to install
- flash the board
  * upload source sketch with arduino IDE
  * or flash binary [(download)](https://github.com/nebman/btc-ticker-esp8266/releases) with [esptool (python)](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) or [flash download tools (WIN)](https://espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools) @ address 0x0
- connect board to power 
- connect your smartphone/computer to ESPxxxxxx wifi
- enter your home wifi settings at the captive portal

## 3D printed case options

these are the 3rd party designs I have tested for this project

Case | Link | Remarks
-----|-----|-----
coinboard|https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2785082 |Wemos D1 only, works okish with some hotglue ([picture](docs/images/photo_coinboard_case.jpg))
ESP8266 Matrix Display Case|https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2885225| printed too small, pay attention to your matrix module size! mine was a little larger
IR Remote Tester|https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1413083|works good (I closed the sensor hole above the display) but screw mechanism needs rework or maybe screw inserts

## known issues

- compilation error in LedControl.h:  
solution: comment out or delete pgmspace.h include


## TODO

* ! correct level-shifting to 5V (3.3V is out of spec, but works anyway)
* ~~add 5th digit for next ATHs ;-)~~
* web portal configuration 
* ~~better error handling (although it seems to be pretty stable with good connection)~~
* ~~maybe use websockets for real-time ticker~~
* ~~add more APIs and currencies~~ plus option to choose
* ~~TLS support for HTTPS requests~~
* ~~options for 3D printed case~~
